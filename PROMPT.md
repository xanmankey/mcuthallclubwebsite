I need a page where the upper half has an image in the background (opacity 0.8), large header white inter text in the center that says "The Royal Highlanders", with smaller text below saying "McCutcheon Hall Club", and below that I want a red and black gradient with smaller header text on the left that says "Upcoming Events" and an image of the upcoming event centered vertically and horizontally on the right . Below that, I want a row that scrolls and is just images of past events. Below that, I want a red to blue gradient, with the smaller header text on the right saying "Pitch your event at one of our Shark Tanks!" with the image centered vertically and horizontally on the left this time. Finally, at the bottom of the page, I want a grid of all of our executives, where each executive is a card of their full name, an image, their role, and a short bio.
